      "2. **Craftsmanship and Artistry**: The intricate hand-painted designs and the skill required to carve perfectly fitting wooden dolls showcase impressive craftsmanship, making them beautiful collectibles and works of folk art.\n",

      "3. **Cultural Icon**: Matryoshka dolls have become a recognizable symbol of Russian culture worldwide, often serving as souvenirs or gifts that carry cultural significance.\n",

      "4. **Playfulness and Curiosity**: The nesting feature invites curiosity and interaction—opening one doll to reveal another smaller one inside creates a delightful experience for both children and adults.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Versatility and Variety**: Over time, nesting dolls have evolved to include countless themes—from traditional peasant women to political figures, animals, and pop culture icons—appealing to a wide range of tastes and interests.\n",
